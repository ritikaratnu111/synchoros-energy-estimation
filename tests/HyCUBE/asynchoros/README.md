# HyCUBE (asynchoros)

This folder includes RTL and testbench collateral derived from the [`HyCUBE project`](https://github.com/aditi3512/HyCUBE).

This copy is included to support the **HyCUBE asynchoros testcase** in this repository; minor local edits may exist for integration/reproducibility.

## RTL design 

- The full chip wrapper exists as `chip_with_pad` → `chip` → `hycube`, but we instantiate `hycube` directly.
- The HyCUBE fabric inside `hycube` is a \(4 \times 4\) tile array (`NUM_TILES_X = NUM_TILES_Y = 4`).

## Testbench

  1) Initialize + reset release
  2) Program Data Memory (DM) 
  3) Program Control Memory (CM) 
  4) Start execution
     - wait a couple cycles
     - set scan_start_exec = 1
     - DUT runs until exec_end indicates completion
